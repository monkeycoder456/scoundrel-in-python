# scoundrel-in-python
fun coding venture that took a about half a days worth of time.\
the concept of the "scoundrel" solitare game was created by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg.\
this was just an adaptation I did for fun because playing it was fun.\
the rules are not exact but if you know scoundrel you can easily play this.\
all you need is python on your local computer because it is a python program.\
this also contains an updated version of my card and deck classes.\
